					<h2>Your stated needs</h2>
				<div>"Each of the team members completed the self-assessment questionnaire and all members had the lowest scores under the Educator's Pedagogic Competences.  We, as a team, are trying to integrate more digital tools into our modules successfully and hope to promote professional development and digital competence within the Department of Accounting & Finance.</div>
				<div>In the short term and more specifically, we are <em>creating a new, fully online, part-time MSc in Machine Learning for Finance.</em> We are in the beginning stages of programme/module design with an initial intake of 30 students in September 2020, with projected figures of 90 students over the next 2-3 years. Keeping the potential growth of the programme in mind, our team has agreed that we would like to focus on the following four areas:</div>
				<div><strong>1. Digital resources:</strong>  This is a data-driven and technology-based programme, so we <em>would like guidance and a community to engage with to have a better understanding of what digital resources would fit best into the programme</em>.  As a team, we would aim to become Experts and Leaders in providing this type of online programme with the ability to share the knowledge beyond this course to encourage more engagement in the digital space throughout the KBS and University of Limerick.</div>
				<div><strong>2. Assessment:</strong> With the potential growth, the team has decided that <em>having assessments to scale in place from the initial design would be the most prudent approach.</em>  We would also like to <em>ensure that the assessments reflect the learning outcomes and give the students the tools that they need in industry</em>.  The goal is to <em>create assessments where feedback and engagement would remain consistent regardless of the number of learners</em> on the programme.</div>
				<div><strong>3. Teaching and Learning:</strong> We have varied experience in the team with teaching online. After discussions, we would like to ensure that we are teaching and engaging at a high level in the online environment and productively integrating digital resources. <em>Our target learners will be professionals, and we would aim to have our approach reflecting this.</em> We want to implement a <em>cohesive approach across the programme</em>to maintain a high quality and well regarded postgraduate course.</div>
				<div><strong>4. Empowering Learners:</strong>  Our target post-experience market are professionals looking to upskill, keeping up with the demand in the market.  The <em>majority of our learners will be in full-time work and at a professional level so we, as a team, are conscious of the type of learner we will be engaging with and would like best practice skills to do so, making the programme inclusive and accessible actively.</em> Our goal would be to have the students leave the programme <em>feeling positive and confident in the skills they have gained</em> by engaging in this course. We are hoping on successful completion of this development opportunity to have designed a high-quality postgraduate course and feel confident in the quality in the delivery of the course going into the future.  We would also like to bring forward the skills that we learn as a team into the rest of our teaching, seeking new and innovative ways to deliver our more 'traditional based' modules and to encourage our colleagues to do the same."</div>
